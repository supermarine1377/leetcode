As a Golang programmer transitioning to Python, it's important to practice solving programming problems in Python to familiarize yourself with the syntax and algorithm problem-solving techniques. LeetCode offers a wide range of problems that cater to various difficulty levels and topics. Here are some problems to get you started with Python and algorithm basics:

1. Easy:

   - "Two Sum" (Arrays, Hashing): https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
   - "Palindromic Number" (Math, Strings): https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/
   - "Reverse Integer" (Math): https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/
   - "Valid Parentheses" (Stacks, Strings): https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
   - "Merge Two Sorted Lists" (Linked Lists, Recursion): https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

2. Medium:
   - "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" (Hashing, Sliding Window): https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
   - "Add Two Numbers" (Linked Lists, Math): https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/
   - "Longest Palindromic Substring" (Dynamic Programming, Strings): https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/
   - "Three Sum" (Arrays, Two Pointers): https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
   - "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal" (Trees, BFS): https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/

Take note of each problem's concepts and difficulty level, and try to work on them progressively, starting from the easier ones. This will give you better exposure to different aspects of Python, while also strengthening your algorithm-solving abilities. Good luck, and happy coding!
